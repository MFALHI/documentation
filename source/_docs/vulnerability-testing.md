Penetration testing is a method of testing site security by probing to find potential vulnerabilities that might be taken advantage of by external attackers. Vulnerability scans are run on an IP address and scan for known security vulnerabilities, such as missing patches and updates, to help you identify potential risks.

## Run a Penetration Test on a Pantheon Site

If you have HTTPS enabled on your site, have an Elite site with a load balancer, or use a CDN such as CloudFlare, open a support ticket with the following information:

 - Domain(s) to be scanned
 - Approximate dates and times of the scan
 - Name of the entity performing the scan
 - Name and contact information for the person who can halt the scan

 <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
 <h4>Note</h4>
 If your site is not on a load balancer, you must limit your scan to ports 80 and 443. </div>

## Penetration Test Results
If anything comes back flagged after testing, please contact Support to discuss the results of your tests.
